# Burningstone's Smart Home Journey
Installation and Configuration of my Smart Home Setup

## Introduction
I discovered Home Assistant around 2 years ago, installed it, played a bit with it, but didn't really have a need for it at that time. Some Philips Hue bulbs and Dimmers later, I gave Home Assistant another try. This time it got me hooked. I became addicted immediately. This was a bit more than 1 year ago. In this time I started to learn Python, YAML, wrote my own code for automations, etc. and setup a system that works pretty stable and covers my current needs. You can find my current setup [here](https://github.com/Burningstone91/smart-home).

Now I will build my whole setup from scratch, add some new features and hardware and you can follow me on this journey. I will keep adding my new configuration and the corresponding documentation continuously to this repo. You may ask, why I do this when I have a stable, running system? First, this will be a documentation that I can use to give me an overview of my system and in worst case (house burnt down + wife lost USB stick attached to key + I lost USB stick attached to key + I lost external drive that I always carry in my backpack, yes I know I'm paranoid :P) help me to setup everything again. Second, I hope that other people can profit from this, learn from my journey, use parts of my config in their own system or at least it helps them to solve one of their issues. And third, my current setup grew quite a lot in complexity. Due to my skills evolving and learning new tricks or methods to do certain things, it became inconsistent in regards to naming and in how and where things are configured and the documentation is lacking heavily. 

!!!WARNING!!! I'm by no means a programmer and I don't work as a professional in IT or something IT related. I'm just passionate about home automation, programming, IoT and technology in general.

My "Server" is an Intel NUC with an i3-7100U CPU, 8 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD (I use it for other virtual machines as well). The Smart Home runs inside an Ubuntu virtual machine in Proxmox.

If you find any information here useful feel free to buy me a coffee :)

## Overview
I will explain here the different parts of my home automation system and how I set them up. For each part, I will talk about the hardware involved and how I integrated it into the system and I will also give an explanation on the automations and the corresponding code related to this part. 


## Start of my Jouney
First some preparations and the install of Home Assistant, which will be the core of the home automation system.

### Preparations
First install Docker and Docker-Compose on the host machine following the official instructions online.

Create the docker-compose file and a directory which will contain the Home Assistant configuration:

```
touch docker-compose.yml
mkdir home-assistant
```

The docker-compose file contains the configuration for the different docker containers that will be running in the stack.

### Configure Home Assistant Docker container
Add the following to docker-compose.yml to configure the Home Assistant Core docker container:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  hass:
  container_name: hass
  image: homeassistant/home-assistant:0.105.2
  network_mode: host
  restart: unless-stopped
  volumes:
    - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - ./home-assistant:/config
```

### Start the docker stack for the first time
Enter the following command while you are in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will read the config from the docker-compose.yml file and start the docker stack in the background. This will take some time as it will now download and install Home Assistant Core.

After the install is finished, Home Assistant should be available under http://ip-of-host:8123

### Initial Home Assistant Configuration
Follow the instructions on the screen to setup the first user, your home location, elevation, time zone and unit system. 

### Structuring the Home Assistant configuration
Enable the usage of packages by adding the following to configuration.yaml:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages/
```

And create a directory "packages" in the same directory as configuration.yaml:

```
mkdir packages
```

Like this, all configuration such as ```switch:```, ```input_boolean:```, etc. that belong to the same logical group (e.g. room) can be put inside a separate file instead of defining everything in the designated block inside configuration.yaml.

Due to this the following lines from configuration.yaml can be removed:

```yaml
group: !include groups.yaml
automation: !include automations.yaml
script: !include scripts.yaml
scene: !include scenes.yaml
```

And the corresponding files groups.yaml, automations.yaml, scripts.yaml and scenes.yaml can be removed as well. 

The following lines can be removed as well:

```yaml
# http:
#   base_url: example.duckdns.org:8123

# Text to speech
tts:
  - platform: google_translate
```

Remove default_config: from configuration.yaml and instead add the following lines:

```yaml
config:
frontend:
person:
sun:
system_health:
```

The final file should look something like this:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages/

config:
frontend:
person:
sun:
system_health:
```

Restart the Home Assistant container with:

```
docker restart hass
```

Now the initial configuration is done and Home Assistant is up and running.
